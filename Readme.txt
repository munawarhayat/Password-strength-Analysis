Main Analysis
Data Loading and Cleaning
The first operation performed was to load the dataset from a CSV file and this formed the first part of our analysis. We also made comprehensive tests to examine if there were any observations with missing values and dealt with them effectively so as to maintain the quality of the data. In addition, any entries like infinity values were not valid entries and were therefore excluded. The cleaned dataset summary was given to create a clear vision of the current state of data and to prepare data for the subsequent analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In the exploratory phase, we visualized several key aspects of the dataset:In the exploratory phase, we visualized several key aspects of the dataset:
Average Password Strength by Time Unit: This was done by creating a bar plot which helped in coming up with understanding of how password strength is changing over the period.
Password Category Distribution: Pie chart was used to visually represent the percentages of various password categories so that variety in the data was apparent.
Complexity vs. Rank: A graphical representation in form of a line plot was employed in realizing the effects that complexity has on rank.
Word Cloud: In order to work with the passwords and make them a little more manageable, we used a word cloud to depict the density of substrings that can be found in the password field.
Statistical Tests
To understand the relationships and differences within our dataset, we performed several statistical tests:To understand the relationships and differences within our dataset, we performed several statistical tests:

ANOVA: These were paired t-tests in order to scrutinize the difference in password strength between the given categories.
Kruskal-Wallis Test: Used in order to explore differences on password strength for specific categories in case the ANOVA assumptions had not been met.
Pearson Correlation: To further investigate the relationship between password value and its strength we looked at their linear relationship.
Feature Correlation Analysis
numerical features in the dataset and then perform the correlation matrix on these numerical features and plot it as well. Using this analysis helped in feature selection by understanding the dependence of one feature to other features, and also helpful in model interpretation.

Machine Learning Models
Several machine learning models were employed to gain deeper insights:Several machine learning models were employed to gain deeper insights:

Support Vector Machine (SVM): For developing classification models; the assessment is made based on accuracy score, classification report, and confussion matrix.
K-Means Clustering: Used for clustering of the dataset with the help of elbow plot in order to select the most logical number of clusters for segmentation.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Employed to transform the data in order to have fewer dimensions with visualization of results in order to see data distribution and its structure.
Deep Learning Models
We explored advanced modeling techniques with deep learning:We explored advanced modeling techniques with deep learning:

Feedforward Neural Network (FNN): Constructed with the aim of encoding password rank predictive capacity, where the model effectiveness is measured by such means as Mean Absolute Error or MAE, Mean Squared Error or MSE, Root Mean Squared Error, and approximately with R-squared score.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Used for successive prediction of password rank, results of training history and performance metrics for prototype determination.
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN): Designed to synthesize new data from the given set of data points, and comparison of real and synthetic data samples in view of the evaluation of synthetic data quality and realism.
Results and Visualizations
The analysis produced several key visualizations and results:The analysis produced several key visualizations and results:

Bar Plots: Represented the average strength in terms of password in relation to the time units.
Pie Charts: Explained the results of passwords distribution by categories.
Line Plots: Illustrated a correlation between password created and the rank that acme had.
Word Clouds: Underlined such specific password substrings as could be observed frequently.
Heatmaps: Posted absolute correlations between numerical characteristics, so that the insights into the characteristics interrelations could be provided.
Cluster Analysis: K-Means clustering results were figured out here and summarized for the convenience of the readers.
PCA Results: Some of the works involved the use of graphs and other graphical aids in portraying the distribution of the principal Components.
Model Performance: Offered the evaluation of the precision and the possible mistakes of different ML & DL models.
GAN Results: Unsupervised student-generated data set and real data set for comparison to determine the quality of the synthetic data produced by the students.
